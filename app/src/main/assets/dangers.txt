Payday loan companies can set up customers to become reliant on them because they charge large fees, and require quick repayment of the loan. This requirement often makes it difficult for a borrower to pay off the loan and still meet regular monthly expenses. Many borrowers have loans at several different businesses, which worsens the situation.
If you rely on the loans, this leaves you with less to spend on what you need each month, and eventually, you may find you're behind almost an entire paycheck.
While offering a quick fix, payday loans do not offer a permanent solution for money woes. If you find yourself needing a payday loan, examine your current financial situation for ways to change how you budget and plan your finances to see if you can free up any extra money.
